# DevContainer + PostgreSQL
Example of managing PostgreSQL in a VSCode project.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [DevContainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)
- [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/)

## Overview
- This project is to show you how to run a local development environment across teams that leverage PostgreSQL as the database. While developing and testing software you will need to ensure that databases share a common schema, and can require data to be loaded so that other developers can test software correctly.
- This is a container based solution that allows you not add additional dependancies on a developers machine.
- This example comes with pgAdmin so that engineers can view the database and the data for understanding and debugging.

### How this works

1. `./.devcontainer/`

    - .env: File that has the configuration for the docker containers
    - devcontainer.json: VSCode devcontainer json file which sets up the environment, you will find the docker-compose file, a post startup command which does the 'liquibase update' and the ports that are exposed
    - docker-compose.yml: The Docker compose file that loads up all required containers.
    
2. `./.db/`

    - liquibase.properties: Contains the credentials that liquibase uses to update the schema
    - mydatabase.xml: controls the revision list, and order to apply schema changes
    - changelog-***.xml: change log files that manage individual revisions to the database schema
    - default-insert-for-admin_config.sql: Data file that is loaded in change-log-5.0.xml; which is related to that specific change
3. `./Dockerfile`: Container that VSCode runs in, this is the terminal with liquibase as a tool.

## How to

1. Open VSCode
2. Open project in container
    - dialog box should show in bottom right corner
    - Or View > Command Palette... > Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
3. [pgAdmin](http://localhost:5050): to view the data in the database.
    - Username: `dude@secret.io`
    - Password: `supersecret`
4. pgAdmin register database:
    - Host Name: `postgres`
    - Database: `mydatabase`
    - Username: `nottheadmin`
    - Password: `metadata`
5. liquibase VSCode terminal: to update database schema via Liquibase


## Debug

- Credentials: `./.devcontainer/.env`
- Liquibase Properties: `./db/liquibase.properties` (credentials must match `.env`)

If you change credentials and they aren't working:
```
docker volume rm $[docker volume ls -q --filter dangling=true]
```
